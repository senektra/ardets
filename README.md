#### Augmented Rapid Development Tracking System

Hi and welcome. This project represents a mock software design lifecycle. It really wasn't meant to
get anywhere as it was meant to be a quarter final project for CMPS 183 at UCSC.

The class introduced a lot of new things I wsasn't very familiar with, namely web2py and vuejs.
Because of that, I think you'll find the source code to be very messy. However, I think it would be a
missed opportunity to not port this project to a modern state.

As I take the time to learn vue v3 and express/node, I'll try to slowly work on porting this app to
those technologies and try to keep the original representation as intact as possible.

Finally, the following excerpt is from my original README.md. I'd like to keep it here as a thank you to
**Luca De Alfaro**, my professor for CMPS 183. As with some of my other professors, he was a select few
that really let his passion for what he taught seep into his course material.
